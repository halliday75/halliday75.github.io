This section describes how to design an agent in Agent Builder.

:::important
The Agent Builder experience is
scheduled to be deprecated starting June 14, 2025. Until then, you can only
design or evaluate existing agents. We recommend you migrate your existing
agents and start using Agents in Studio Web. For details, refer to [Migrating agents to Studio Web](https://docs.uipath.com/agents/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/migrating-agents-to-studio-web#migrating-agents-to-studio-web).
For
creating new agents, refer to [Building an agent in Studio Web](https://docs.uipath.com/agents/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/building-an-agent-in-studio-web#building-an-agent-in-studio-web).
:::

1. In UiPathÂ®
   Automation CloudTM, select **Agents** from
   the left-hand navigation bar. The **Agents** workspace is
   displayed.
2. From the list of Preview Agents,
   select an agent to open the Agent Builder.
3. The Agents workspace includes three
   tabs: **Design**, **Evaluations**, and **Traces**.
   * Use the **Design** tab to design and define the core elements of your
     agent. Once you define the input/output arguments, you can use this
     space to preview your agent runs.
   * Use the **Evaluations** tab to create evaluations and store results.
     Evaluations objectively measure your agent's output and assess whether
     or not it is consistent with your objectives.
   * Use the **Traces** tab to log and represent all design and evaluation
     time traces for this agent. This is where you can see all the agent runs
     and the details of the run.
4. Select the large language model you
   want to use with your agent. Models are provisioned through UiPath AI Trust Layer.
   a. To configure model settings,
      select the settings icon next to the **Model** field. Here you can
      configure the **Temperature** and **Max. tokens per response** fields.
      * The
        **Temperature** determines the creativity factor of the
        LLM generation. You can set a value between 0 (Precise) and 2
        (Creative).
      * **Max. tokens
        per response** refers to the maximum number of tokens to
        generate with the agent's response.
5. In the **General** tab, edit the
   agent name and description. The name and description of the agent must offer details regarding the
   purpose of the agent in simple language. The description is used to help
   identify the agent in Studio.
6. In the **Prompt** tab, add a well-structured system prompt and a user prompt
   to give your agent instructions for what it should do, and constraints it should
   follow.
7. Select **Arguments** to access the **Arguments** window, where you can
   configure the input and output arguments used in your prompt.
8. In the **Tools** tab, add any
   tools your agent can use during execution. These can be a set of Integration Service
   activities, published processes to which you have access, or other agents. Each tool must have a detailed description that helps inform the agent how
   and when to use this tool.
9. Use the **Contexts** tab to add
   any necessary context. Context Grounding indexes give an agent access to permissioned knowledge
   bases. This helps ground agent actions or answers in your business data.
10. Use the **Escalations** tab to
    add a human in the loop and enable Agent Memory. Adding an escalation allows your agent to involve a human to review, approve,
    or update output as it is running.
11. In the **Playground** window,
    provide input for a test run and select **Run**. You must test your agent to ensure it's operating as expected.
12. Next, go to the **Evaluations**
    tab to review and measure your agent. An evaluation is a pair between an input and an assertion made on the output,
    and can be used to grade your agent during an end-to-end run.
13. After you run the evaluations, use the **Traces** tab to review all the
    trace logs for your agent.
14. Once you have tested, evaluated, and
    refined your agent, select **Publish** to publish it to Orchestrator as a
    process.
    * Select where to publish:
      + **Orchestrator Personal Workspace Feed** - The process
        is published to your personal workspace and will only be
        available to you. This is the default selection.
      + **Orchestrator Tenant Processes Feed**- The process is
        published to the global tenant feed and will be available to all
        users assigned to folders that use the tenant feed.
    * Select a version. A version is generated automatically starting with
      1.0.0 when you first publish, and then incremented automatically every
      time you republish.
      
    :::important
    This step is necessary for the
    agent to be available in the **Run Job** activity.
    :::

    Select **Export** to view and package the agent definition as a JSON. You
    can then use this JSON extract to import the agent in a different
    organization.
15. Finally, insert your agent into an automation using the **Run Job** activity
    in Studio. For details, refer to [Running the agent](https://docs.uipath.com/agents/automation-cloud/latest/user-guide/building-an-agent-in-agent-builder#running-the-agent).

## Running the agent

Using agents as activities means you can incorporate them into workflows to
handle parts of larger deterministic processes, have multiple agents act in
series, and start agent execution based on triggers.

To incorporate your agent into a workflow, follow these steps:

1. Publish your
   agent to Orchestrator.
2. In Studio, use the [Run Job](https://docs.uipath.com/activities/other/latest/workflow/run-job)
   activity to integrate your agent into a workflow.
3. Whenever you make changes to your agent, republish the
   updated agent to Orchestrator and upgrade the
   corresponding process in Orchestrator. The [Run Job](https://docs.uipath.com/activities/other/latest/workflow/run-job)
   activity always executes the version of the agent
   currently configured in Orchestrator. This ensures
   that your workflow consistently uses the most
   up-to-date version of your agent.

Refer to the [System activities guide](https://docs.uipath.com/activities/other/latest/workflow/run-job) to
learn how to configure and use the **Run Job** activity in your Studio
workflows.

:::note
Starting with UiPath.System.Activities version
25.4.2, the execution of agents and other Orchestrator jobs has been
consolidated and improved under the **Run Job** activity.
Existing workflows using the [Run Agent](https://docs.uipath.com/activities/other/latest/workflow/run-agent) activity
continue to function without changes, ensuring a smooth transition.
When adding new agent-running functionality to your workflows, the
system automatically suggests and implements the **Run Job**
activity, even if you search for **Run Agent**.
